RNDmigration
=======

ComputerRND - project#1 -RNDmigration (A web-page and web-form migration module) As of 4/28 I am preping the src code and updating the UML docs. my current focus is on my naming system scheme. In other words... I have the src components coded and tested as modules. I am now naming tags, methods, files and objects into the overall framework. Knock on wood!. I should! be uploading a fairly functional 1st-draft-version very soon.
