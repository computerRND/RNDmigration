RNDmigration
=======

ComputerRND - project#1 -RNDmigration (A web-page and web-form migration module) As of 4/28 I am prepairing the src code and updating the UML files. Current development is focused on the component naming scheme. In terms of overall progress: I have the base components coded and tested as modules. I am now finishing a regex friendly naming scheme for the files, folders, classes, methods and objects. Knock on wood!. I should! be uploading a fairly functional 1st-draft-version very soon.
